        <P> This website re-design aimed to support PAWS and their mission of fostering “No Kill” communities by highlighting certain services. Our goal is to highlight features such as a user-friendly adoption process, and offer a clear way for users to become volunteers, as stakeholders stated this is their key concern. </P>

        <h4> Government Website Re-design </h4>
        <P> During this case study I worked with the website for the National Archives of Australia.  I ran user tests to observe how the user navigated along the original website. Through testing I found that the website could benefit from a simplified menu and clearer pathways to popular places the user needed to visit. I also created a more cohesive design that matched the subject. </P>
